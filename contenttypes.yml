      This contenttype has been created especially for the **big-picture** theme. It can of
      course be used for anything else. Use the Weight field to organise the page.
    fields:
        title:
            type: text
            class: large
            group: content
        slug:
            type: slug
            uses: title
        weight:
            postfix: "<p>You can use the Weight field to specify in which order the Paragraphs are placed.</p>"
            type: integer
        body:
            type: html
            group: content
            postfix: There is no maximum length however try to keep it short. Around 480 characters looks very nice.
        background:
            type: image
        gallery:
            type: imagelist
            postfix: Using the Gallery will automatically enable the Gallery view.
        style:
            type: select
            values: [ style1, style2 left, style2 right, style3 primary, style3 secondary ]
            postfix: |
              The section can then be assigned a style class to determine its basic
              look (and, in some cases, its behavior):

                **style1**
                Centered content with an oversized **Title**. Works best when paired with a background image or color.

                **style2 left**
                Content in a box, anchored to the left side of the window. Works
                best when paired with a background image or color. If you have
                "useSectionTransitions" turned on in your settings, the box will
                slide into view from the left.

                **style2 right**
                Content in a box, anchored to the right side of the window. Works
                best when paired with a background image or color. If you have
                "useSectionTransitions" turned on in your settings, the box will
                slide into view from the right.

                **style3 primary**
                Used for generic content. Set against the primary background
                color (default is white).

                **style3 secondary**
                Used for generic content. Set against the secondary background
                color (default is a light gray).
        innerstyle:
            type: select
            values: [ box, container, container small]
        menu:
            type: checkbox
            default: 1
            postfix: |
              If the content is in the Menu or not
        main:
            type: checkbox
            default: 1
            postfix: |
              Defines if the content is Main content or not. This let's it transition or be static.
        dark:
            type: checkbox
            postfix: |
              Flips the content's color scheme so it shows up better
              against darker background images and colors.
        fullscreen:
            type: checkbox
            default: 1
            postfix: |
              Makes the section fill the entire window (only if "useFullScreen" is enabled in your settings).
    sort: order
    show_on_dashboard: true
